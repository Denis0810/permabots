========
Usage
========

With Permabots you can build chat bots and with the same configuration use it for several instant messaging providers. Permabots
was born to be a microservice to connect messaging providers to your apps using REST APIs.

A bot in Permabots defines how to react to each client messages. To build responses the bot works with a context to generate responses with Jinja2 templates.
This bot behavior can be shared by several instant messaging providers, saving time.

.. note::

	Permabots django app do not have a dashboard. You can configure bots with the REST API (recommended) or using django admin.
	Remember there is an online implementation with dashboard in Permabots.com_ you can use it for free.

Facebook Messenger
-------------------

Permabots only require ``Page Access Token`` but webhook can't be set automatically. Facebook Messenger requires
to set it in its dev dashboard. Permabots generates webhook with bot integration id which is ``uuid``.
This url completed with your domain will be used as the webook ``https://yourdomain/processing/messengerbot/permabots_messenger_bot_id/``
When Facebook requires a ``Verify Token`` for validate webhook use bot integration id.

.. note::

	Bots integrations can be enable/disable whenever to avoid processing

------------------
Context
------------------

Context is used to parametrize processing and to render templates. Some context data is available just bots starts its processing and other is attached as a result of the processing.


----------------
Environment
----------------

Each bot can have an environment to generate key/value variables to use them accross all processing context. Environement is attached in context as ``env``

.. tip::
	
	Imagine you are using some auth token to build API requests, set token in environment instead of copying in every place you need it.

-------------
States
-------------

Permabots works generating responses depending on the input, but this is not enough. A bot can be modelled as a state machine and depending on
its actual state handle messages. Several states can be defined for each bot.

Permabots maintains associations between chats and states. 

Context used in the state transition is attached to the state. Previous state context can be accessed  with ``state_context`` variable.

.. tip::

	This is useful for example when making some kind of form of questionary to store responses.

Conversation Handlers
----------------------

A Conversation Handler defines how to react to an incoming message.  

	* Pattern: Regular expression the incoming message must fullfil to be executed	
	* Request: An HTTP request
	* Response: Templates to generate text and keyboard response
	* Source States: Bot must be in one of the states of this list to be executed
	* Target State: State the bot transitionates when its is processed successfully
	* Priority: It is usefull when more than handler fullfil conditions to be executed

Notification Hooks
-------------------

Notification hooks can be used to send messages to clients. Just define a response to be generated by POST data
and a list of recipients for different providers.
